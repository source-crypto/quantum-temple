name: Master Epic #20 AGP - Autonomous Geo-Protocol
---

## Description
This epic covers the implementation of the Autonomous Geo-Protocol.

### Tasks:
- **Phase 1: Proof-of-Movement components**
  - #22 Mobile GPS logger: Implement a mobile application using React Native to log GPS movements.
  - #23 Smart Contract: Develop a smart contract in Solidity that verifies movement.
  - #24 Validator Node: Set up a Node.js service for validating the data from the GPS logger.
  - #25 Privacy Layer: Introduce privacy layers using zk-SNARKs.

- **Phase 2: 3D Road Modeling**
  - #26 General 3D model design for the roads.
  - #27 NFT Contract: Create an NFT contract in Solidity for road representations.
  - #28 Rendering Dashboard: Build a dashboard using TypeScript to visualize the 3D models.

- **Phase 3: Tokenomics**
  - #29 Tokenomics Overview: Document the reward formula and staking economics.
  - #30 DAO Governance: Create structures for decentralized governance of the token.
  - #31 Carbon Credits: Develop features for tracking carbon credits.

- **Phase 4: Testing**
  - #32 Testing frameworks and methodologies for the AGP.
  - #33 Testnet Deployment: Deploy the project to a testnet.
  - #34 Mobile Beta: Launch a beta version of the mobile application.
  - #35 Validator Incentives: Create an incentive structure for validators.
  - #36 Whitepaper: Write a detailed whitepaper.

### Integration Issue
- #39 Integration for AGP+QTC ecosystem design.

### Detailed Task Descriptions
Each task should include relevant code templates and acceptance criteria.

### Anti-Fraud Specifications
- GPS validation: Ensure that GPS data is genuine.
- Physics checks: Validate that the movement data complies with physical laws.
- Sensor fusion: Integrate multiple sensor data to bolster credibility.

### Privacy Designs
- zk-SNARKs: Incorporate zero-knowledge proofs.
- Ring signatures: Utilize ring signatures for transaction privacy.
- Stealth addresses: Employ stealth addresses for anonymity.

### Tokenomics Parameters
- Reward Formula: Define clear metrics for rewarding users.
- Staking Economics: Outline the staking process clearly.

### Acceptance Criteria
What defines the completion of each task should be articulated clearly.
