# Project Roadmap for QTC + AGP

## Executive Summary
This roadmap provides a comprehensive overview of the Quantum Temple project, focusing on two main components: Quantum Token (QTC) and Agile Governance Protocol (AGP). The project aims to innovate cryptographic solutions while ensuring robust governance.

## Phase Breakdown
- **Phase 1: Research**
  - Issues: #5, #6, #7, #8
  - Objectives: Conduct thorough research on quantum cryptography principles.

- **Phase 2: Development**
  - Issues: #9, #10, #11, #12, #13
  - Objectives: Build the necessary components for QTC.

- **Phase 3: Testing**
  - Issues: #14, #15, #16, #17, #18, #19
  - Objectives: Test components for security and performance.

- **Phase 4: AGP Integration**
  - Issues: #20 - #39
  - Objectives: Integrate governance solutions with QTC functionality.

## Integration Architecture
